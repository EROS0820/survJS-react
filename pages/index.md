## What will I learn by reading this book?

Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) powers an increasing amount of sites. There is a good reason for this. It simplifies frontend development greatly. Combined with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), a bundling tool, you have a powerful frontend development environment in your hands.

*SurviveJS - Webpack and React* shows you how to build a simple [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29) application based on these technologies. During the process you will learn to:

0. Set up a Webpack based development and production environment. You will learn to get most out of [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for development.
0. Improve the quality of your code by using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and friends to spot possible mistakes earlier.
0. Get into the React mindset while learning the basics of [Alt](http://alt.js.org/), an implementation of [Flux Application Architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html).
0. Style your React application in various emerging ways.
0. Implement drag and drop for your application using [React DnD](https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/).

I expect you know the basics of JavaScript but beyond that not much is needed. You just need to have patience to work through the book and poke me in case there's something you don't understand!

I, [Juho Veps채l채inen](https://twitter.com/bebraw), have been dealing with the web one way or another since the 90s. All hail *marquee*! I've seen the rise of web and JavaScript in particular. Besides React I have extensive experience in Angular, jQuery and various smaller libraries (mapping, charts, whatnot).
