## What is SurviveJS - Webpack and React?

I remember when I saw [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) the first time. It took me a while get over JSX. Once I got into the right mindset, React started to make sense. During the process I had to unlearn some things and start thinking about state and most importantly components and lifecycle.

Facebook's React will change the way you think about frontend web development for better. Once you understand the basic concepts it will make you better as a web developer. Most importantly it allows you to become more efficient even if you don't stick with it.

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is a tool I picked up later on. It simplifies work greatly as it solves the difficult problem of bundling. In addition it enables fast development flow with React and integrates well with various other technologies. In short it has allowed me to forget some of the grunt work involved (pun intended!).

*SurviveJS - Webpack and React* is the book I wish I had when I started delving into React. It's not impossible to pick up these tools without support of a book. However, I believe this book will help to get you jumpstarted in the process.

I expect you know the basics of JavaScript but beyond that not much is needed. You just need to have patience to work through the book and poke me in case there's something you don't understand!

## What's in it for me?

</div>

The book is project based. I will show you how to set up a Webpack based development environment. After that I will help you to develop a Kanban application. Finally I will discuss deployment and library authoring related issues. The project won't be very complicated but I can assure you that you will learn a lot in the process.

The project and book source are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react). In addition I have linked to the project source and demos on this website.

## How to support?

Even though the book is freely available under [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license, financial support is welcome. It will allow me to devote more time developing the content. If you think this is a worthy cause, you can purchase [an electronic copy of the book](https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack).

## Who wrote this book?

I, [Juho Vepsäläinen](https://twitter.com/bebraw), have been dealing with the web one way or another since the 90s. All hail *marquee*! I've seen the rise of web and JavaScript in particular. Besides React I have extensive experience in Angular, jQuery and various smaller libraries (mapping, charts, whatnot).

In addition to web development I have worked using C (embedded and systems level) and computer graphics. On backend side I'm most familiar with Node.js although I've done some work with PHP and Ruby.

## Why was the book written?

I've been blogging a few years at [nixtu.info](http://nixtu.info/). This book is an attempt to turn my freelancing career into a different direction. I hope it will yield a good way to combine my interest in technology with writing while helping the community.

This book probably wouldn't have gotten written in its current form unless I had started [a cookbook about Webpack and React](https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/) with [Christian Alfoni](http://www.christianalfoni.com/) and received a rejection from a publisher. In addition numerous people have devoted their precious time towards improving the book so thanks for that!
