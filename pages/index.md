## What is SurviveJS?

Getting started with JavaScript can be painful. Technology keeps on improving all the time and it can be difficult to keep up. That is where *SurviveJS* comes in.

The first book of the series, *SurviveJS - Webpack and React*, focuses on [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Combined these two technologies provide an excellent starting point for modern web application development. Webpack solves bundling whereas React solves the view.

## What's in it for me?

*SurviveJS - Webpack and React* is the book I wish I had when I bumped into these technologies the first time. It would have saved a lot of time and headache. But worry not. You don't have to be as unlucky.

I have distilled my knowledge about the topic in this book in an easy to follow format. Following the book you will build a simple Kanban application that can be used for tracking tasks. When ready you can even you use it with your own projects.

The project and book source is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react). The book isn't entirely tutorial-driven. Some parts provide you more general view of the web development scene. For instance I discuss topics such as styling and library authorship in greater detail.

## When will the book be available?

An early version of the book is already available. I keep track of the status of the book in [the project README](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react#progress). Especially early chapters and a couple of the later ones are in a good condition. Feedback is very welcome.

After initial release and depending on how that goes I will develop new content to the book based on demand. Other installments are possible as well. But this all depends on how well we get started.

## How to support?

Even though the book is freely available under [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license, financial support is welcome. It will help me to devote more time improving the content and developing new one. If you think this is a worthy cause, you can purchase [an electronic copy of the book](https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack).
