-# Implementing Kanban

In this part, we will turn our Notes application into a Kanban application. During the process, you will learn the basics of React. As React is just a view library we will also discuss supporting technology. Alt, a Flux framework, provides a good companion to React and allows you to keep your components clean. You will also see how to use React DnD to add drag and drop functionality to the Kanban board.
