# Preface

A lot of web development is about dealing with various assets. You'll have things like javascript, stylesheets, templates, images, fonts, configuration, you name it. In the end you want an optimized package that is your application. This package should be downloaded to the browser as fast and intelligently as possible to give the best user experience. 

## What's In It for You?
Webpack is one of those tools that can make it considerably simpler to reach this exact goal. Traditionally you might use a set of external tools and glue them together. You might set up something like a Gruntfile or a Gulpfile and do a bit, or a lot, of scripting and configuration to get a build done. Webpack has the same goal, but the approach is different. This might initially make you scratch your head, but with the help of this book you will not only understand how Webpack works, but also how it will benefit your every day life as a developer.

## What Does Webpack Offer?
At its core Webpack understands how your application loads assets and how those assets depend on each other. All assets can individually, or by type, be processed by Webpack giving you the ability to attach transpilers, base64 converters etc. 

In addition to this it comes with its own development server that you can either run in parallell with your existing server or as a separate process.

Webpack also has some features that none of the other bundle tools has, but we will let you find those in the book.

## Who This Book Is For

If you are developing web applications Webpack can help you and your project. It is expected you have a basic understanding of JavaScript. We won't discuss the intricacies of the language though we will show you some things that lie in the future. After reading this book you will know how to take advantage of Webpack to produce a highly optimized application package.

Even if you happen to use Webpack already, reading this book should be valuable. Webpack has many features and while explaining those we try to give you a good general understading of what Webpack actually is and how you can take advantage of its powerful features on your own.

## How This Book Is Organized

We will start by delving into the basics of Webpack and try to make sense of the system as a whole. We will get your first workflow running and then expand on that. After this you should be able to hook up Webpack with your favorite alternative JS languages and start developing on a basic level.

Next we will dig into assets, CSS, fonts and images in particular. We will discuss various strategies for dealing with these basic asset styles. You will learn how to get automatic CSS refresh during development for instance. We want to turbocharge you as a developer.

Of course no application remains a prototype forever. You will want to deploy something at some point. The simplest way is just to generate a single bundle and hope for the best. In more complex cases you will want something more clever. We will show you how to achieve that. We will also touch on React JS a little bit to show one powerful approach.

Finally we will build on top of this knowledge and help you understand Webpack on a deeper level. You will learn techniques that can help you to improve your build and development workflow further.

The code presented in this book, as well as errata and discussion forums, can be found on its PragProg page: TBD.
