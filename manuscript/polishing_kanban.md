# Polishing Kanban

Our Kanban application is almost usable now. It doesn't look that bad and there's some basic functionality in place. In this chapter I'll show you how to take it to the next level. We will integrate some drag and drop functionality as we set up [React DnD](https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/). After this chapter you should be able to sort notes within a lane, drag them from a lane to another and sort lanes.
