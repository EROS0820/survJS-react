<img align="right" width="248" height="360" src="manuscript/images/title_page_small.jpg">

Webpack, a module bundler, solves a significant problem for web developers. It can be daunting to learn but once you grok it, life gets easier. Same goes for React, a JavaScript library for building UIs. This book shows you how to build a little Kanban application using these technologies. During the process you will learn the basics and will be able to take the skills to your own projects.

The book was inspired by work done with [react-webpack-cookbook](https://github.com/christianalfoni/react-webpack-cookbook).
