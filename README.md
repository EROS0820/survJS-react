Webpack, a module bundler, solves a significant problem for web developers. It can be daunting to learn but once you grok it, life gets easier. Same goes for React, a JavaScript library for building UIs. This book shows you how to build a little Kanban application using these technologies. During the process you will learn the basics and will be able to take the skills to your own projects.
