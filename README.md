# Build with Webpack -- Guide to Module Bundling

This is the private repo for possible commercial version of the book. I've split it up in a couple of parts:

* TOC.md - Proposed table of contents with brief descriptions
* n-<section>*.md - Full section. Numbered to match TOC to make it easier to handle.
