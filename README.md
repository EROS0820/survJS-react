# Build with Webpack -- Guide to Module Bundling

This is the private repo for possible commercial version of the book. I've split it up in a couple of parts:

* TOC.md - Proposed table of contents with brief descriptions
* <section>*.md - Full section

To generate a pdf version of the book, hit `npm install` and `npm start`. After that you should have `book.pdf` at the project root.
