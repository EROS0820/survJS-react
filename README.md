# SurviveJS - Webpack

This is a project based book that teaches you to use Webpack and React.js effectively. It has been derived based on [react-webpack-cookbook](https://github.com/christianalfoni/react-webpack-cookbook).

## Generating

I've split it up in a couple of parts:

* TOC.md - Proposed table of contents with brief descriptions
* <section>*.md - Full section

To generate a pdf version of the book, hit `npm install` and `npm start`. After that you should have `book.pdf` at the project root.
