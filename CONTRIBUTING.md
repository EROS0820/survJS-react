One of the unique aspects of this book is that its development happens mostly in the open. You can actually see as develops. As a result you'll be able to contribute just like for any open source project.

I welcome both PRs (typo fixes and such) and issues. If you have a lot of smaller issues in mind per chapter, I recommend setting up a single issue that contains possible problems in [a task list](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#task-lists). If you notice something smaller, an individual issue per problem is fine. Even questions are welcome.

You can also send me freeform feedback through [email](mailto:bebraw@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bebraw).

Even if the things you have in mind might feel trivial, they can help me to improve the book further. I want to provide the best experience within my capability. It is very easy to lose perspective on the book as I spend time with the topic. Therefore any insight you may provide will come in handy!
