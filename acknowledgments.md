# Acknowledgments

New build tools seem to appear all the time. Just during the past few years we have seen Grunt, Gulp, Browserify and Webpack. Webpack is one of those tools I underestimated for a while. As the website says, it's a module bundler. Incidentally this is one of those tasks that is in the heart of frontend web development. It is all about bundling different types of assets into an easy to consume form.

Once you understand the power of Tobias Koppers' tool, you can make your life as a web developer much simpler. I thank him, and other contributors of Webpack, for easing my life. And incidentally making this book possible.
