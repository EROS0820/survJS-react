# Acknowledgments

New build tools seem to appear all the time. Just during the past few years we have probably heard of Grunt, Gulp, Browserify and Webpack, which we are going to talk about in this book. Webpack is one of those tools both of us underestimated for a while. We believe there to be a couple of reasons for that. First of all webpack takes a different approach than the other tools mentioned. Though it is very much a module bundler, it takes a very generic approach to what a module is.

It is not just a javascript file. It can be anything really and that is exactly what makes Webpack so powerful. We do not only need to bundle javascript files, we need to bundle stylesheets, maybe some JSON configuration, images and even fonts. Not only that, we typically want to process those assets with transpilers, BASE64 conversion etc. This is what any professional web application project requires. It is all about bundling different types of assets into an easy to consume form for the browser.

Once you understand the power of Tobias Koppers' tool, you will be ha happier developer and your users will be happier consumers of your highly optimized web application. We thank him, and other contributors of Webpack, for easing our lifes as developers, and giving us the opportunity to tell you about how you and the projects you work on can benefit from this amazing tool.
